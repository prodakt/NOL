### NOvel LncRNA identification/detection
This repository contains a set of scripts for sensitive and effective identification of novel (NO) lncRNA (L) = NOL

The whole pathway consist of a few steps:
- the first filtering (by lncRNA basic characteristics)
- the second filtering (classification by coding potential)
- accuracy validation
- the final classification
- plotting


The technical steps:
- running all necesary preliminary steps
- preparing input and configure files
- reading input files (data, metadata and configure files)
-
